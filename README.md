## About

POOF is a finance management program specifically designed for the internal use of a medical equipment company based in Egypt called Multimedica ScO. 
This project started when I suggested automating the price offer/quotation-making process from filling data out in a Microsoft Excel data sheet and stylizing it manually every time to a web application that takes input from the office secretary, fills out a premade, stylized form, then exports it into an Excel template, this both makes the process streamlined and easier. In addition, this application keeps track of each submitted price offer and which user submitted it, allowing for better performance monitoring at the company. More features might be added as I go as this is a work in progress, and I will keep this repo updated with any extra features added later on
